        <h1>Sprint 2 - Answer reflection questions</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong>
	•   I want to work in an industry that is forward thinking and promotes creativity. My short term goal is to gain enough skills to become a freelancer, then eventually becoming my own boss.  
	    <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
	•   I want to be able to confidently explain products and processes to people. I find that I have trouble articulating my ideas. Honing my teamworking skills will also be extremely useful in the future, specifically leadership.
	    <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong>
    <em>Strengths</em>
	⁃	I think I’m a good communicator, I work well with others.
	⁃	I am compassionate and have good leadership skills.
	⁃	Creativity and problem solving are a core reason I am drawn to this career.
        <em>Limitations</em>
	⁃	I find it difficult asking for help and at times receiving criticisms
	⁃	Once I’m locked in I will work endlessly, but this is partly because of my issues getting focused in the first place.
	⁃	I can be extremely pessimistic sometimes, I am generally positive in demeanour, but perhaps struggle to aim high.
	    <strong>Based on the below description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. </strong>
	•	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
	•	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
	•	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
	•	These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
	⁃	I am committing to working on foundations everyday of the week without fail
	⁃	I aim to complete each sprint before the due date or at least before the weekend of each respective week.
	⁃	My work will be done mainly on workdays in the morning and afternoon, avoiding evening work if possible
	⁃	If I have any problems, I will first google, then post on the slack channel or visit the campus.
	⁃	I would like to go to the campus at least once a week
	⁃	I expect facilitators to be available during work hours to answer questions regarding the course that can’t be answered by colleagues
	⁃	I expect opinions/pointers on my work if I ask for it.
	⁃	I have work commitments 10 hours a week, split into 5hrs Monday and 5hrs Friday.
	⁃	I also need to schedule times for cooking, as well as eating lunch and dinner
	⁃	I also want to ensure I get up at least once every and leave the house at least once a day haha
