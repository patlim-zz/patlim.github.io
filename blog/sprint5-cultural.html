        <h1>Foundations Core Skills</h1>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong><br>
            - I am better at working on my own time than I thought.<br>
            - I can ask others for help, but do tend to push through difficulties as I believe that’s true learning.<br>
            - When learning about growth mindset, I have realised that I have always had that this mindset.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
            To be honest, I don’t know how values play part in learning. They are important in programming when working
            with others and what projects you produce. I think empathy and self awareness are incredibly important as
            you are working with teams and creating something for others. So you must understand how things are perceived
            and used, so empathy is incredibly important.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
            I have been surprised by how difficult some of these exercises were. They are incredibly time consuming and
            challenging. This goes to show they are really pushing me into trying things I am not accustomed to.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
            Compared to programming where I can work through projects using logic. Core learning takes time and emotional
            thinking which required a lot more energy in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course?</strong><br>
            When I had been recommended dev academy I did here there was time focused on core learning. But I didn’t realise
            it would be almost half of the foundations course.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead?</strong><br>
            I don’t think it was a waste of time. I think it’s important to know how to learn as the industry is ever-changing.
            Emotional intelligence will take you far in terms of career growth. Knowing your strengths and having the mindset to
            improve limitations is something not everyone spends time on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to have a job lined up before the course is over. I expect to come out of the course with industry standard
                 skills and a good foundation to learn other languages and skills going forward. I would like to gain experience at
                 a single company for a couple years then attempt to freelance and travel. From there I would like to explore starting
                 a company with a focus on my interests or potentially real estate (my career before dev academy)
             </p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations?
                    Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</strong><br>
                My greatest limitation is focus, I have drive but I find it difficult to get started. I have been much better than expected
                and hope to keep this up in bootcamp.<br>
                I am a very pessimistic person and I like to be a realist, but I have tried to stay positive about my future career<br>
                Along the same lines, I have added a growth mindset to my strengths. I have always had one, but now that I am aware of it
                I will try to cultivate it.<br>
                I  also tend to compare myself with other, this can be draining, I need to limit this.<br>
                I think my limitations with wanting to ask for help will be tested in bootcamp. I love to solve problems alone, but so far
                in foundations I have been able to ask for help and will continue to work on this in bootcamp.
            </p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
                In foundations I was able to keep on top of material as I have backing from my computer science degree. I worry that with
                the amount of work in bootcamp and the complexity will catch up to me.<br>
                I also have been able to really push myself through foundations and try to finish sprints early. I hope to keep this up in
                bootcamp, but worry about my stamina.<br>
                I also think I will struggle to maintain reflections and journaling throughout bootcamp. <br>
                What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? I think my human skills
                are decent to start with, but one thing in particular is leadership. I believe I can lead, but I would like to improve that
                skill within a team. Also receiving feedback isn’t a strong suit, I respect others opinions, but just naturally am not fantastic
                with criticism. <br>
            </p>
            <h2> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp </h2>
            <p>
                I will seek help from my Human Skills facilitator Dougal Stott and my colleagues.<br>
                Starting with google, colleagues then facilitator.<br>
                I will attempt to work everyday, particularly longer hours in the work week and leaving some free time in the weekend. I will
                spend my time at campus, particularly early on in the week to avoid last minute rushes. I will try keep a steady sleep pattern
                and take breaks. I will attempt to meal prep in the weekends to limit time waste. I will also maintain my current gym/social
                sport schedule throughout bootcamp.<br>
