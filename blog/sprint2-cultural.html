            <h1>Sprint 2 - Answer reflection questions</h1>
            <strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong>
            <p>I want to work in an industry that is forward thinking and promotes creativity. My short term goal is to gain enough skills to become a freelancer, then eventually becoming my own boss.</p>
            <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
            <p>I want to be able to confidently explain products and processes to people. I find that I have trouble articulating my ideas. Honing my teamworking skills will also be extremely useful in the future, specifically leadership.</p>
	        <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong>
            <p><em>Strengths</em><br>
                I think I’m a good communicator, I work well with others.<br>
                I am compassionate and have good leadership skills.<br>
                Creativity and problem solving are a core reason I am drawn to this career.
            <em>Limitations</em><br>
                I find it difficult asking for help and at times receiving criticisms<br>
                Once I’m locked in I will work endlessly, but this is partly because of my issues getting focused in the first place.<br>
                I can be extremely pessimistic sometimes, I am generally positive in demeanour, but perhaps struggle to aim high.
            </p>
            <strong>Based on the below description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. </strong><br>
            <em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.<br>
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.<br>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br>
            These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.<br><br>
            </em>
            <p>
                I am committing to working on foundations everyday of the week without fail<br>
                I aim to complete each sprint before the due date or at least before the weekend of each respective week.<br>
                My work will be done mainly on workdays in the morning and afternoon, avoiding evening work if possible<br>
                If I have any problems, I will first google, then post on the slack channel or visit the campus.<br>
                I would like to go to the campus at least once a week<br>
                I expect facilitators to be available during work hours to answer questions regarding the course that can’t be answered by colleagues.<br>
                I expect opinions/pointers on my work if I ask for it.<br>
                I have work commitments 10 hours a week, split into 5hrs Monday and 5hrs Friday.<br>
                I also need to schedule times for cooking, as well as eating lunch and dinner<br>
                I also want to ensure I get up at least once every and leave the house at least once a day haha.
