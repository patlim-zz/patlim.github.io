            <strong>Self Evaluation</strong><br>
            <em>The Good</em><br>
            Introverted with spurts of extroversion<br>
            Compassionate and empathetic<br>
            Strong willed and passionate<br>
            Love efficiency and live a particularly curated life<br>
            I enjoy being in the thick of it, I want to be amongst the bustle<br>
            Contradicting that, I like peace and my own space<br>
            Realist, but not to the point I limit myself<br>
            Leadership qualities<br>
            <br>
            <em>The Bad</em><br>
            I also enjoy complaining more than I should<br>
            Care a bit too much how others perceive me<br>
            I used to be more assertive, I want to work on that<br>
            Not as friendly as I used to be as well, turning into a grumpy old man?<br>
            Lack of focus, sometimes when I find I can float by I do<br>
            I need to work on my ability to receive criticisms and advise<br>
            Very unpunctual<br>
            Judgmental<br>
            Forgetful, which is compounded by relicense on Siri and reminders<br>
            I can be impatient and lack trust in others to get things done<br>
            <br>
            <em>Values</em><br>
            Effectiveness<br>
            Peace/Tranquility<br>
            Compassion<br>
            <br>
            <em>Ethical Decision</em><br>
            In my role as a real estate salesman, my goal is to make the maximum profit for the company.
            There have been situations where a buyer is buying their first property and are tapped out. I will try my best to get the fairest price for them, let them know they don’t have to offer more.
            Finding equal ground for profit for the business and making sure these people aren’t over-extended.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Cultural Background</em><br>
            With immigrant parents from Malaysia, I feel that I have a unique experience. I grew up while they were still struggling, but not incredibly poor. By the time I was born they had decent footing in New Zealand. They are both incredibly strong willed, very charismatic and likeable. They were the stereotypical tiger parents, but as we grew up have really loosened up. That I think has contributed to my more laid back characteristic. As my mum says, I act more and more like my dad. (Not the worst thing, he’s incredibly quick witted, respectful and fantastic with people)
            <br>
            School in Auckland has always been diverse, I have had friends of every background since birth. While my parents have definitely felt some racial struggles, I rarely do(Big reason being my upbringing here). I have had my struggles with it, directly and subtly. I deal with it the right way, when its harmless and comes from a lack of understanding I will say something but I don’t push to hard. I deal with it like my parents, politely and directly if necessary
            <br>
            Strengths and limitations in terms of learning and career development I think I carry myself well, am outgoing and friendly when necessary. I do care about what others think about me and I know first impressions really matter. My ability to work with others will come in handy with this course. However as I have mentioned, I sometimes lack trust in others. I need to drop my, “if you want it done right, do it yourself” mentality. I like to keep people happy and generally have a positive disposition. I do recognise my limitations with receiving criticisms and advise needs to be worked on. I do lack in focus, but love efficiency (I think they cancel out, especially when I have deadlines).

            <em>Past team working conflicts</e><br>
            There had been situation where a workmate is not pulling their weight. I don’t think I dealt with it perfectly. Clarity is number one.

            <strong>Rebekah’s Thoughts (Partner)</strong><br>
            Cross Referencing<br>
            Agrees that I am compassionate, but also oblivious at times.<br><br>
            She also mentions that I always strive to be content and happy, but once I achieve it I don’t live in the moment.
            <br>
            <em>Values</em><br>
            Clarity<br>
            Tranquility<br>
            Purposefulness; “I think you yearn for purposefulness” - Elly (flatmate) in agreement on this one<br>
            Calm<br>
            Creativity<br>
            Sustainability<br>

            <strong>Chris’ Thoughts (Friend of 11 years)</strong><br>
            <em>Values</em><br>
            Change; “You are changing career path”<br>
            I think this relates to Rebekah’s thought that I can’t live in the moment. I am on a constantly striving to be content, which is either driving change or perhaps is a sign that I find it difficult to be content and be present.<br>
            Courage; “One time you smoked and drank beer at the same time”<br>
            Integrity; “I know if I give you money, you will always give/pay it back”<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Loren’s Thoughts (HR at when I resigned)</strong><br>
