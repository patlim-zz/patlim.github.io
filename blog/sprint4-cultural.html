        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">Understanding neuroplasticity can benefit those of the fixed mindset.</p>
        <p class="p2">This is great for children, students or anyone really.</p>
        <p class="p2">Poor math skills can be worked on and improved, your able to train and improve these skills.</p>
        <p class="p3">
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>Discuss how we might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</em></strong><br>
            - Firstly a mindset change, understanding that I can improve in my areas of weakness<br>
            - I need to practice and spend plenty of time at it<br>
            - I must care about what I’m training and maintain good habits<br>
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</em></strong><br>
            - Clarity - Important when starting out any behaviour change<br>
            - Practice and keep learning<br>
            - Set goals<br>
            - Build a routine<br>
            - Less stress<br>
            - Enough sleep<br>
            - Learn a language or instrument<br>
            - Eating fish &amp; turmeric (why not both?)
        </p>
        <p class="p3">

        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>Link to the resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">Here’s an interesting article Michael Merzenich’s brain-training and rehabilitation VR game:</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">Clarity, like I mentioned above, is important when starting out a new behaviour change.</p>
        <p class="p2">In the same sense, people must first believe the growth mindset and that through practice and dedication, they can improve.</p>
        <p class="p3">
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">I am surprised by how clear the results are in schools and why it isn’t practiced everywhere. For me, I can be quite stubborn and think my weaknesses and my weaknesses. But I need to keep the mindset that these things can change and be improved.</p>
        <p class="p5">
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">With every sprint and challenge, I need to come in believing I can take them on and succeed.</p>
        <p class="p2">I need to take failures or disappointment as learning experience.</p>
        <p class="p2">Do it for myself and cultivate a sense of purpose salience.</p>
        <p class="p2">Don’t compare myself with others.</p>
        <p class="p2">Lastly my favourite, replacing self doubt with the word “yet”.</p>
        <p class="p5">
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><strong><em>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</em></strong></p>
        <p class="p2">I didn’t really use this as part of my answers, but Carol Dweck goes further in-depth into her study of growth mindset is great.</p>
