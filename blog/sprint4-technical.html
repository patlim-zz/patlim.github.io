        <h1>Sprint 4 - Technical Blog</h1>
        <h2>Here are some of my sprint 4 struggles and resolutions</h2>
        <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p class="p1">So I’ll start of by explaining that some programming languages are object orientated.</p>
        <p class="p1">This means that you can assign values to variables, similar to in algebra with x = 2 or y = -12.</p>
        <p class="p1">You can name these variables many ways, but there are rules and some guidelines.</p>
        <p class="p1">I found myself stuck on a problem for about twenty minutes, I was going in circles.</p>
        <p class="p1">Posted to the slack channel, as soon as I did, I noticed the problem was a misspelled variable.</p>
        <p class="p1">One letter, twenty minutes of pain.</p>
        <p class="p1">I used console logging, reading error messages and googling to be honest none of that helped.</p>
        <p class="p1">What would have worked is if I stepped away for a moment or asked a colleague.</p>
        <p class="p1">This was super frustrating and probably even more so when I figured out the issue</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
        <p class="p1">There was a problem I was working that tested to see if two variables had the same result.</p>
        <p class="p1">These variables, let’s call them Adam and Terah, are quite complex and essentially contain a collection of variables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="p1">I released instead assigning various values and typing everything out again I can simply make Adam = Terah</p>
        <p class="p1">I started out with pseudocode, which helped me understand and visualise these complicated variables.</p>
        <p class="p1">Also a whole lot of console logging to understand where I was going wrong.</p>
        <p class="p1">This problem was a confusing as I tried the other method and it didn’t work.</p>
        <p class="p1">When I solved the problem, the satisfaction was very real.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
        <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
        <p class="p1">Fairly confident with my pseudocode. Used it a few times throughout this sprint and it seemed to help my understanding from the get go</p>
        <strong>Trying something</strong>
        <p class="p1">I did a lot, even going back and doing problems with different methods. I feel quite confident with this as there’s a lot of ways to skin a cat</p>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
        <p class="p1">Not super confident with this method, just haven’t practiced it enough. But it is a very elegant idea and I would like to try more of it</p>
        <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
        <p class="p1">Did a lot of this, I feel pretty confident with it</p>
        <strong>Console.logging</strong>
        <p class="p1">This is probably my favourite way to solve problems. I’m extremely visual, so being able to see and compare on the screen helps a lot</p>
        <strong>Googling</strong>
        <p class="p1">Google is my best friend, there’s so many people running in to the same problems</p>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
        <p class="p1">I did this, but had a eureka moment. I feel comfortable asking, but much prefer grinding through problems myself</p>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
        <p class="p1">I haven’t done this yet, I have a few questions that I’d like to bring up with my coach though.</p>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
        <p class="p1">I think reflection has helped, taking a step back and understanding my processes. I don’t feel that confident in my reflections, but I definitely think they help even if it’s more subtle.</p>
