            <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <h3>The ability to understand, use and manage your own emotions in positive ways. Such as relieving stress, communicating effectively, empathising with others, overcoming challenges and defusing conflict.</h3>
            <p>
                IQ - The ability to process information and come to sound decisions<br>
                EQ - the ability to process emotions - both others’ and your own, using them think and make sound decisions<br>
                <br>
                EQ can be a more effective indicator of potential success.
                There has been correlation with EQ and leadership potential, employability, and even health.
                Emotional intelligence will distinguish you as an effective leader<br>
                <br>
                IQ ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills, logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking, filter irrelevant info. <br>
                EQ actually forms the foundations for all your interactions/impulses, including learning process; thus effecting IQ and cognitive development.<br>
                From what I’ve read, it seems difficult to really say which is more important.<br>
                In workplace - EQ leads to better teamwork, leadership and successful relations.<br>
                Whereas with IQ, you’ll have success with challenging tasks, ability to analyse and connect dots, research and dev<br>
                The key is EQ can be improved and it exteremly important in career development, so improving those skills and attributes are extremely valuable.<br>
                <br>

                <strong> The five core attributes of emotional intelligence </strong><br>
                <em>Self Awareness </em><br>
                    - The ability to understand your effect on others, play to your strengths and admit your weaknesses<br>
                <em> Empathy</em><br>
                    - No just listening to others, but really trying to understand their point of view<br>
                <em>Motivation</em><br>
                    -  Having the innate passion to challenge yourself and remain optimistic with the going gets tough<br>
                <em>Self regulation/management</em><br>
                    - Being able to control impulses and avoid acting rashly<br>
                <em>Social Skills</em><br>
                    -  ability to manage relations and productively express your emotions<br>
                    <br>
                <strong>Ways to develop EQ</strong><br>
                <em>Practicing self awareness</em><br>
                    Know what you’re doing (turn off auto-pilot)<br>
                    Know what you’re feeling<br>
                    know your own emotional bullshit<br>
                    <br>
                <em>Channeling your emotions well</em><br>
                    No such thing as a good or bad emotion - just good and bad reactions to your emotions<br>
                    <br>
                <em>Learn to motivate yourself</em><br>
                    “Do something principle” - taking action is not just the effect of motivation, but also the cause of it<br>
                    <br>
                <em>Recognise emotions in others to create healthier relationships</em><br>
                    Listen and share yourself honestly with others<br>
                    You don’t necessarily have to understand others, but rather to accept them as they are, even the you don’t understand them.<br>
                    <br>
                <em>Infuse your emotions with value</em><br>
                    In order to live the life you truly want to live, be clear about what you truly value because that’s where your emotional energy will be directed.<br>
                    Conmen are highly emotionally intelligent, so is a salesman. They value themselves above others.<br>
