        <h1>Foundations Core Skills</h1>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong><br>
            - I am better at working on my own time than I thought.<br>
            - I can ask others for help, but do tend to push through difficulties as I believe that’s true learning.<br>
            - When learning about growth mindset, I have realised that I have always had that this mindset.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
            To be honest, I don’t know how values play part in learning. They are important in programming when working
            with others and what projects you produce. I think empathy and self awareness are incredibly important as
            you are working with teams and creating something for others. So you must understand how things are perceived
            and used, so empathy is incredibly important.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
            I have been surprised by how difficult some of these exercises were. They are incredibly time consuming and
            challenging. This goes to show they are really pushing me into trying things I am not accustomed to.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
            Compared to programming where I can work through projects using logic. Core learning takes time and emotional
            thinking which required a lot more energy in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course?</strong><br>
            When I had been recommended dev academy I did here there was time focused on core learning. But I didn’t realise
            it would be almost half of the foundations course.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead?</strong><br>
            I don’t think it was a waste of time. I think it’s important to know how to learn as the industry is ever-changing.
            Emotional intelligence will take you far in terms of career growth. Knowing your strengths and having the mindset to
            improve limitations is something not everyone spends time on.
